        <h2>Education and Interests</h2>
        <p>I am a student of class 7b at The Horizon High School. My favorite subject are English, Maths and Computer. I like going to the computer lab and writing code. I find it difficult but I will practice hard and learn it. My other interests are playing games with my friends.</p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I like to swim, play mobile games and football. In my vacations, I used to go play football daily with my friends. Sometimes my brother used to take me to swimming at KMC. He taught me how to swim but I am still learning. I also play freefire on my tablet with my friends every day for 2 hours/</p>
        <h2>Career ambitions</h2>
        <p>I want to be a youtuber and gamer. I developed passion in youtube because I keep watching videos on youtube all the time. I really enjoy gaming videos. I have a lot of fun while watching these videos and I try to follow my favorite gamers. I also want people to follow me like that.</p>
